    "it. \\n\\nBut I’m back here today to outline how far we’ve come and what -- at least from our perspective -- what path we \n",
    "should chart moving forward.\\n\\nAnd let me start with where we believe we are.  When we announced the Cancer Moonshot, \n",

    "\\n\\nPresident Nixon, when he declared War on Cancer in 1971, he was earnest and sincere and very committed.  But what\n",
    "makes the difference between then and now is -- the single big difference is that he had no army.  He had no resources.\n",
    "He had no weapons.  He had no strategy to win.  \\n\\nBut after 45 years with many of you in this room doing incredible work,\n",
    "45 years of progress, after decades of funding research, training scientists and physicians, treating millions of patients,\n",
    "we now have an army.  We now have powerful new technologies and tools, like:  Immunotherapy that -- by the way, even six, \n",
    "eight, 10 years ago was viewed kind of as a voodoo science out there.  It wasn’t really an integral part of this fight -- \n",
    "that makes cancer cells visible to the immune system so our natural defenses can destroy the cancer. \\n\\nSurgeons are using\n",
    "cutting-edge robotics to allow for more precise imaging to find the cancer and more precisely surgically remove the cancer \n",
    "in hard-to-reach areas.\\n\\nLiquid biopsies that find early signs of cancer in the blood and tell you whether or not you \n",
    "have a particular cancer.    \\n\\nThese advances and many others provide hope that more precise medicines and diagnostics\n",
    "might greatly improve and detect and defeat cancer.  \\n\\nBut on so many levels, we’ve now reached an inflection point. \n",
    "When the system was set up before, we thought there was basically only one cancer in different parts of the body.  We’ve\n",
    "now learned there are over 200 specific kinds of cancers.\\n\\nAfter decades we thought we could tackle cancer one discipline\n",
    "at a time.  But thats not how cancer operates.  Cancer uses every tool at its disposal -- it hides from the immune system, \n",
    "it builds it own blood supply system, it uses viruses to spread, it engineers a friendlier environment, a cellular \n",
    "environment in which to survive.\\n\\nAnd it knows how to spread through the body using pathways and mutations we don’t \n",
    "understand fully yet.  And cancer never gives up, it never surrenders.  That's why we have to use every discipline cancer\n",
    "does, and that's what we’re starting to in a way that's only really begun in the last five or six, seven years.\\n\\nFive\n",
